# What size is my browser?

Determine the dimensions of your browser

## Synopsis

This idea struck me as a combination of two concepts I had seen before; [a webpage with page dimensions][page-dimensions] and [inferring data from the webpage with no JS at all][stealing-the-pie].

I jotted this down and decided to act on it. I present to you, [What size is my browser?][gh-pages]

[page-dimensions]: http://matanich.com/test/viewport-width/

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint your code using [grunt][grunt] and test via `npm test`.

Design decisions were made via [Moqups][moqups].
